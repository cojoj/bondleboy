# Bundleboy
If you've ever tried to pull `CFBundleIdentifier` from your **Xcode project** using shell script, well... You've probably did BUT if you'd like to get `CFBundleIdentifier` automatically eg. while using **Xcode Bots pre-script** you've probably face the wall.
This simple script is a solution to this problem.

## Installation

#### The fast way

This is a `shell` script so the installation is pretty basic.  
Just clone this repo 
```
git clone https://github.com/cojoj/bundleboy.git
```

and `cd` to this directory:
```
cd bundleboy/
```

For the sake of success allow execution of this script by calling:
```
chown u_x bundleboy.sh
```

From now on you can use this script by calling:
```
./bundleboy.sh
```

#### The global way

If you want to use this script globally with easy access you'll have to move it to either `/usr/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`. In this example I'll move it to the first location by calling:
```
mv bundleboy.sh /usr/bin
```

Now you can use `bundleboy` command from whenever you want!

## Usage

If you run `bundleboy` script without any argument it'll execute in current directory, so be sure this directory contains either `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` file.  
Besides this `bundleboy` offers tho argument options:

- `p` - accepts the given path as a path to Xcode project directory (which contains `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace`)
- `x` - this argument is to be used with **Xcode Bots** so it automatically grabs project path from bots variables (`$XCS_SOURCE_DIR`)

## Why would I need this anyway?

I'll provide with my real-life scenario for this script. I use **Xcode Server** for Continous Integration in my company bu we also wanted to implement Continous Delivery with [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools) tools.
Unfortunately, it's really hard to automatize this whole process because you have to provide some pre-script and post-script which may require some use input (Xcode don't allow you to interact with these). In my case what I needed was `CFBundleIdentifier` to check provisioning with [sigh](https://github.com/KrauseFx/sigh). Xcode Bots don't give you sufficient info with their variables but they give you enough info to write proper script and fetch those info by yourself - so that's why `bundleboy` was created.
